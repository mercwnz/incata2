# 🚗 Fun Car Project! 🚗

Welcome to the Fun Car Project! This project helps you read data from your car and do fun things with it. Let's get started! 🎉

## What is this? 🤔

This project has some magic Python code that can:
- Read data from your car's OBD-II port (that's a special plug in your car that gives information) 🚘
- Read data from NMEA devices (these are gadgets like GPS that tell you where you are) 🌍
- Read data from an INA219 sensor (this measures how much electricity is used) ⚡
- Validate data to make sure everything is working correctly ✅

## Files in this project 📂

Here's a list of the important files and what they do:

1. **main.py**: This is the main script that runs everything together.
2. **validate.py**: This script checks if everything is working properly.
3. **obd2.py**: This script reads data from your car's OBD-II port.
4. **nmea.py**: This script reads data from NMEA devices.
5. **INA219.py**: This script reads data from the INA219 sensor.
6. **devenv.nix**: This file helps set up the development environment.
7. **pyproject.toml**: This file contains important information about the project and its dependencies.

## How to set it up 🛠️

Follow these steps to set up the project on your computer:

1. **Install Nix**: Nix is a tool that helps you set up your development environment. You can install it by following the instructions [here](https://nixos.org/download.html).

2. **Set up the environment**: Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder. Then run this command:
   ```
   nix-shell devenv.nix
   ```
   This will set up everything you need!

3. **Install dependencies**: Run this command to install the necessary Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to run it 🚀

1. **Run the main script**: In the terminal, type:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   This will start the program and begin reading data!

## How to use it 📖

- **OBD-II data**: The `obd2.py` script will help you get information from your car's OBD-II port, like speed, engine temperature, and more.
- **NMEA data**: The `nmea.py` script will read data from GPS devices and tell you where you are.
- **INA219 sensor data**: The `INA219.py` script will measure how much electricity is being used.

## Have fun! 🎉

Explore the data and see what cool things you can do with it! Whether you're checking your car's health or tracking your location, there's a lot to learn and enjoy.
